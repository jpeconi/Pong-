# Pong-
Pong remake in html Canvas


This is a simple remake of the arcade classic pong. Written in JS. Use the mouse to control your paddle.
Variables are labelled easy enough that if you want alter the difficulty or speed up the ball or whatever
you would like to do, feel free. Might add some functionality here shortly to have different levels of difficulty
and an option to use the keyboard to control your paddle. I first had it with keyboard controls and found it clunky,
so I switched to the mouse which is a much nicer feel.
